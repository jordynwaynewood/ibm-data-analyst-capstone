# IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone
  This repository documents my journey through completing the final capstone project as part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. This project allowed me to apply the range of data analytics skills and techniques I've acquired throughout this program. 
  You'll see me demonstrate my proficiency in various tools and libraries. I worked with Jupyter Notebooks, SQL, and BI tools like Cognos, as well as Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and more. 
  The highlight of this project is the interactive dashboard and comprehensive data analysis report I created.
